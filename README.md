# rushabhbot


## for this bot assignment I will be pulling data from Spotrac to give alerts whenever the Blatimore Orioles make a roster move. Given that the orioles are making constant roster moves such as calling up players from the minor leagues and moving players to and from the injury roster, I think it would be a good idea to notify people of that. https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/baltimore-orioles/overview/_/year/2025 is this site I will use to fetch the data for this bot and I plan to store the data in a json format as well. Right now I have the requests, json, and slack libraries as of now, I am not sure if I'll need to add beautiful soup to get the data just yet but I'll see if it needs to get added. Now I just need to get the data from the website, store it in a json format, and print the news out in a f string format. I'm just not sure how I will etract the roster news specifically however.
