# rushabhbot


## for this bot assignment I will be pulling data from Spotrac to give alerts whenever the Blatimore Orioles make a roster move. Given that the orioles are making constant roster moves such as calling up players from the minor leagues and moving players to and from the injury roster, I think it would be a good idea to notify people of that. https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/baltimore-orioles/overview/_/year/2025 is this site I will use to fetch the data for this bot and I plan to store the data in a json format as well. Right now I have the requests, json, and slack libraries as of now, I am not sure if I'll need to add beautiful soup to get the data just yet but I'll see if it needs to get added. Now I just need to get the data from the website, store it in a json format, and print the news out in a f string format. I'm just not sure how I will etract the roster news specifically however. 

## March 28 UPDATE

## As of right now I am currently trying to figure out how I can now make my bot only ping slack when a roster move is made by the O's. I have the code that gets the players information from Spotrac and it can print when I run the file in codespaces, however I need to figure out how this can be automated (unless it already is) and have it only ping when it needs to. This is what I am trying to work through and if there are any pointers regarding this I would love to hear them! I think I got to take a lot out of this process of making the bot. I strengthened my web scraping skills through this assignment and have a good idea how to get information from a site. I also learned how slack bots work and how to get things like keys to put into GitHub secrets which I did not know was a thing. A lot of the data from Spotrac can be grabbed with just inspecting the page and looking through the HTML of the page, I learned how to look at things such as "a tags" and ul which helped me get the contract data off the site. From my intial steps, the only thing I really changed was deciding against storing the data in a json format, I might pivot towards writing the data in a CSV format though.
